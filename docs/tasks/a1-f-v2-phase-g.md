# A1-F v2 — Phase G: graph adjudication

**Status: DECIDED (revision G-R2) — AWAITING RE-REVIEW.**

Two review rounds. G-R1 corrected four P1s and moved the count from 13 to 11;
G-R2 corrected two more, neither of which moved it. See §9.

Phase G is one decision, written and reviewed on its own, before any v2 drafting.
The node set determines ranks, edges, imported roots, closure and digest domains;
drafting v2 with the node set still open means drafting it twice.

## 0. Inputs and authority

implementation_probe:
  pr:     124 @ b2ba165
  role:   EVIDENCE for E-V0-4 only (see section 6)
```

**Prototype code is evidence, never a presumption.** The design input has fifteen
envelope kinds. That fact carries exactly as much authority as any other
observation about how somebody once wrote a Rust enum. The number this document
reaches is derived from consumers, not from a `#[derive]`.

## 1. Method

Default disposition for every existing v1 classification is `KEEP_V1_MODEL`. The
burden of proof lies on promoting a support object, introducing a node, changing
imported-root semantics, or replacing rank as the authority.

Per-object test, applied identically to every candidate:

```text
Does it independently require:
  1. logical message identity?
  2. causation / lineage?
  3. acceptance / idempotency lifecycle?
  4. independent replay addressability?
  5. controller / provider / human producer authority?
Insufficient answers -> it remains a support object.
```

The decisive evidence is **in-degree**: which other objects reference it, from
how many distinct kinds, and across what edge class. An object nothing references
does not need an identity, whatever its schema looks like.

## 2. Evidence: the reference graph of the design input

Mechanically derived from `crates/o7-a1-protocol/src/edges.rs` at `37502e3`.
The metric needs a name and an exclusion rule, or an independent reviewer runs
"the same" script and gets a different number — which, after the 141-row
episode, would be a particularly avoidable way to repeat a lesson.

```text
registry total                                59 entries
  envelope-source edges          e(...)       53
  A2 attention-transition edges  t(...)        6
plus, in the registry KAT, one global rule:
  GLOBAL | causation.blob_ref | AnyCommittedEnvelope | Causal

specific V0 consumer in-degree(X) :=
  count of envelope-source edges whose target is exactly Envelope(K::X)

  EXCLUDING
    - the 6 A2 transition-source edges          (not V0)
    - the global AnyCommittedEnvelope causation rule and any open target
      (AnyCommittedEnvelope, AnyImportableCas) — generic reachability is
      not evidence that a specific consumer needs this object
    - edges whose only consumer is a POST-V0 feature (see §3.1)
```

The open-target exclusion matters for honesty, not only for arithmetic: as a
prototype envelope kind, `ArtifactImported` is formally reachable through the
global causation rule, so its raw in-degree is not zero. Its *specific consumer*
in-degree is. The conclusion in §3.4 is unchanged, but it now rests on a metric
that says what it counts.

The table below is specific V0 consumer in-degree.

| Candidate kind | out | **in** | referencing kinds |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `WorkOrder` | 6 | 0 | — (round entry point) |
| `CoderReport` | 3 | 1 | CandidateAdmissionReceipt |
| `CandidateAdmissionReceipt` | 3 | 2 | ReviewRequest, … |
| `ReviewRequest` | 4 | 0 | — |
| `ReviewerReport` | 2 | 1 | ReviewVerdict |
| `ReviewVerdict` | 3 | 3 | — |
| `CorrectiveDirective` | 3 | 0 | — |
| **`ProviderInvocationReceipt`** | 9 | **3** | CoderReport, ReviewerReport, HumanAttentionRequest |
| **`InteractionManifest`** | 3 | **1** | ProviderInvocationReceipt only |
| `CampaignFeedItem` | 1 | 0 | — |
| `HumanAttentionRequest` | 5 | 1 | — |
| `HumanCommandRequest` | 1 | 1 | HumanDecision |
| `HumanDecision` | 3 | 0 | — |
| **`CampaignRunBinding`** | 5 | **2** | CandidateAdmissionReceipt, ProviderInvocationReceipt — both `Intra`, both controller-produced. A third raw in-edge, `safe_redrive.prior_run_binding_ref` (`Causal`), is excluded: its only consumer is POST-V0 (§3.1) |
| **`ArtifactImported`** | 2 | **0** | **no specific consumer** (formally reachable only through the global open-target causation rule, which the metric excludes) |

External wrapper **raw explicit in-degree** — a deliberately different metric,
counted without the V0 exclusions so that POST-V0 references stay visible:
`CandidateStateReceipt` 6, `CandidateMaterialization` 3,
`WorktreeMaterialization` 2, `RunContractCandidateState` 2,
`RunArtifactSource` 1 (from `ArtifactImported` alone),
`EstablishedNonDispatchEvidence` 1 (from the SafeRedrive cause alone — a POST-V0
reference, which is exactly why this column is not the V0 metric).

## 3. Q1 + Q2 — node universe, and the envelope/support boundary

### 3.1 `CampaignRunBinding` → existence **REQUIRED_V0**, classification **TYPED SUPPORT AUTHORITY**

Existence was never the question: it is the only object bridging logical
campaign/round/role to physical execution/conversation/run/attempt plus the input
state actually materialized, and V0 needs that bridge.

Classification is a different question, and the first pass answered it with two
arguments that do not survive checking:

- **The `Causal` SafeRedrive edge cannot count.**
  `ProviderInvocationReceipt.cause.safe_redrive.prior_run_binding_ref` is the
  only cross-round in-edge, and SafeRedriveV2 is POST-V0 (§3.5). Using it as
  V0 promotion evidence lets a post-V0 consumer determine pre-V0 wire ontology,
  which is backwards.
- **"Two distinct producer lanes" is factually wrong.** `required_producer()` at
  `37502e3` (`edges.rs:538-541`) classifies `CoderReport` as `Provider("coder")`,
  `ReviewerReport` as `Provider("reviewer")`, `HumanCommandRequest` as `Human`,
  and *everything else*, including both `CandidateAdmissionReceipt` and
  `ProviderInvocationReceipt`, as `Controller`. Both referencing kinds are one
  lane.

What remains is specific V0 consumer in-degree **2**, both `Intra`, both
controller-produced. The envelope-specific question is then:

```text
Which V0 invariant requires of CampaignRunBinding
    a message_id, envelope causation/lineage, and an
    acceptance/idempotency lifecycle
that cannot be provided by
    typed support identity + the exact edge registry
    + a controller uniqueness invariant?
```

No such invariant was found. Content identity suffices, since it is referenced by
digest, and its lineage is carried in-band, which is exactly what a support
object is entitled to do (§3.2 explains why that is not a defect).

**Uniqueness, corrected.** G-R1 wrote that "one binding per execution" is
enforceable when the *referencing* artifact is accepted. That is the wrong
authority point, and wrong in the direction this project exists to avoid. The
design input allocates `run_id`/`attempt_id` durably *before* provider dispatch,
and the binding is the source of that physical identity, so the real order is:

```text
allocate execution E -> construct binding B -> PROVIDER DISPATCH
                                            -> ... later ...
                                            -> ProviderInvocationReceipt
                                            -> CandidateAdmissionReceipt
```

Checking uniqueness only when a later referencing artifact is accepted checks it
after the side effect has already happened. Two bindings for one execution could
both clear the pre-dispatch stretch, and rejecting one of them afterwards repairs
nothing. That is the exact inversion of R1's "durable acceptance before provider
invocation".

The invariant Phase G requires, without choosing an event schema for it:

```text
Pre-dispatch binding admission

Before the first provider dispatch for execution E, the controller durably
establishes exactly one binding identity B for E.

  E + same B       -> idempotent replay
  E + different B  -> conflict, fail closed, NO provider dispatch

After a restart, E resolves to the same B before the execution may continue.
```

Where that authority point lives — a campaign event, reducer state, or another
controller-owned durable record — is a v2 drafting decision, not a Phase G one.
What Phase G fixes is that it must exist and must precede dispatch.

**This is a controller/reducer lifecycle obligation and is not, by itself, a
reason to promote the binding to a message.** Requiring durable pre-dispatch
admission says the *controller* must hold state before acting; it says nothing
about the binding needing a `message_id`, envelope causation, or an acceptance
lifecycle of its own.

**Reopening trigger, recorded so it cannot be quietly skipped:** if the v2 draft
turns out to be unable to express pre-dispatch binding admission without giving
the binding a message lifecycle, this adjudication reopens. No present evidence
suggests it will.

Independently addressable graph authority is not the same thing as an
envelope-bearing message, and v1 already demonstrates the difference: the
execution receipt and the interaction manifest participate in the evidence DAG,
carry typed refs and are replay-addressable, without envelopes of their own.

**Disposition:** a new typed support authority in v2. Promotion remains available
if a later phase produces the envelope-specific invariant this one could not.

### 3.2 `ProviderInvocationReceipt` → **KEEP_V1_MODEL** (support object)

The first pass promoted it. The argument was wrong, and it is worth recording
exactly how, because the error is a general one.

**Withdrawn: the FD-5.3 argument.** The claim was that v1 forces the receipt to
violate FD-5.3 by carrying `campaign_id` and `round_id` in its own payload. It
does not. FD-5.3 governs *payloads of envelope-bearing artifacts* — "payloads
never restate an envelope-owned field". The receipt has no envelope by
construction, so those fields are not restating anything; they are its own
provenance.

**Withdrawn: "promotion removes two congruence predicates".** It does not. FD-11
checks `report.envelope.campaign_id == receipt.campaign_id` to prove the receipt
belongs to the same campaign and round as the report being accepted. That is
cross-object provenance congruence. After promotion it would simply read
`receipt.envelope.campaign_id` — the obligation survives verbatim. The first pass
mistook a cross-object equality proof for intra-object denormalization. Those are
different things, and one of them is not a defect at all.

**Insufficient on its own: in-degree 3.** A content-addressed support object may
have any number of consumers, and v1 demonstrates exactly that. Being referenced
is not being a message.

No envelope-specific invariant remains. Under this document's own default rule,
the disposition is `KEEP_V1_MODEL`: the receipt stays a support object, and the
frozen classification stands.

### 3.3 `InteractionManifest` → **KEEP as a typed support object**

In-degree 1, from `ProviderInvocationReceipt` alone. No consumer outside its own
receipt, no independent acceptance, and its identity is meaningful only relative
to the execution it describes. Tests 1, 3 and 4 fail. Promotion in the design
input is symmetry with the receipt, not a consumer.

That symmetry is precisely what the burden of proof exists to refuse. Two objects
that appear together in one paragraph are not thereby the same kind of thing.

### 3.4 `ArtifactImported` → **NOT PROVEN — out of A1-V0**

**Specific V0 consumer in-degree = 0** (§2). No V0 object references it; its only
edges are outgoing, to `AnyImportableCas` and to `RunArtifactSource`. Its *raw*
degree is not zero — the global open-target causation rule formally reaches it —
which is why the metric is named rather than assumed.

Three questions were kept separate, and only the first two are answered here:

```text
run -> CAS import operation needed?     plausibly YES  (mechanism)
durable import proof needed?            plausibly YES  (mechanism)
independent graph node needed?          NOT PROVEN
envelope-bearing message needed?        NOT PROVEN
```

An import mechanism can exist as a controller procedure whose product is an
ordinary CAS object with a recorded provenance, without minting a node.

v1's refusal of `ArtifactAcceptance` (FD-2.3) is worth remembering here as a
**caution against speculative nodes**, and not as proof: the two objects do the
same thing to a graph but not the same thing to a system, and treating the
resemblance as identity would import a conclusion instead of an argument. The
disposition rests on the absent consumer alone, which is sufficient.

Consequence: `RunArtifactSource`, whose only in-edge comes from
`ArtifactImported`, leaves the V0 wrapper set with it.

### 3.5 `EstablishedNonDispatchEvidence` → **POST_V0_DEPENDENT_ON_SAFE_REDRIVE**

In-degree 1, exclusively from `ExecutionCause::SafeRedrive`. With SafeRedriveV2
deferred, it has no V0 consumer. The design is preserved as a prepared record for
v2.1 rather than discarded.

This carries a standing condition, recorded because it is exactly the kind of
thing a word can quietly take with it: **the FD-14.7a barrier is MUST-V0 and is
unaffected.** Post-dispatch ambiguity safety is not automatic pre-dispatch
redrive. Deferring `EstablishedNonDispatchEvidence` defers the *resolution path*,
never the *barrier*.

### 3.6 Result — the v2 node universe

```text
envelope-bearing kinds: 11
  the eleven v1 kinds, unchanged — KEEP_V1_MODEL on the boundary question

typed support objects / authorities:
  + CampaignRunBinding          (3.1, REQUIRED_V0, new support authority)
    ProviderInvocationReceipt   (3.2, kept — promotion argument withdrawn)
    InteractionManifest         (3.3, kept)
    ScopeContractV1             (v1, unchanged)
    CampaignEventPayload        (v1, unchanged)

out of V0:
    ArtifactImported            (3.4, not proven)
    RunArtifactSource           (3.4, falls with it)
    EstablishedNonDispatchEvidence (3.5, post-V0)
```

**Eleven.** The envelope boundary of the frozen contract survives adjudication
unchanged, and V0 gains one new object that is an authority without being a
message.

The first pass reached thirteen. It got there by promoting two objects on
arguments that did not survive checking (§3.1, §3.2) — and the shape of that
error is worth keeping in view, because both promotions were reached after
reading a fifteen-variant enum. `KEEP_V1_MODEL` was declared the legitimate
default at the top of this document; the discipline is only real when the default
actually wins something.

## 4. Q3 — edge and rank model

**The exact edge registry becomes authoritative. Rank becomes derived.**

Evidence from v1's own history rather than from preference: rank had to be
redefined twice under pressure. R5.1 restated rank 0 from "opaque bytes" to
"terminal in the reference graph" for `ScopeContractV1`, and FD-2.4 had to carve
imported roots into it separately. A property that needs redefining every time a
new object arrives is behaving like a derived quantity being used as a primitive.

Frozen for v2:

```text
authority:  a closed per-kind allowed-edge registry — exact source, exact
            field-path tag, exact target, edge class

derived_rank :=
    topological level over the closed INTRA A1 TYPED-NODE subgraph, where the
    typed nodes are:
      - envelope-bearing message kinds, and
      - typed support objects / authorities that participate in the graph
        (ProviderInvocationReceipt, InteractionManifest, CampaignRunBinding,
         ScopeContract, CampaignEventPayload)
    Graph-terminal external wrapper and CAS targets terminate traversal.

    No global rank is defined over Causal edges, and none can be: the full
    graph does not topologically sort, because cross-round causal references
    are acyclic per instance rather than per kind.
    Retained as a checkable property and as review shorthand, never as the rule.

acyclicity: Intra   — proved by topological sort over the typed-node subgraph
            Causal  — proved per instance by create-before-reference
            never asserted from rank monotonicity
```

Two rounds of narrowing, in opposite directions, and the second is the one worth
explaining. The first pass wrote "rank, computable from the registry", which is
too wide. G-R1 then narrowed it to the *message-kind* subgraph, which is too
narrow — and wrong precisely because of what G-R1 had just decided. The three
demoted objects are not terminals: `ProviderInvocationReceipt` has out-degree 9,
`CampaignRunBinding` 5, `InteractionManifest` 3. A chain like

```text
CoderReport [message] -> ProviderInvocationReceipt [support]
                           |-> InteractionManifest [support]
                           `-> CampaignRunBinding  [support] -> External / CAS
```

would fall out of the proof entirely if the domain were messages only. Frozen v1
had this right and is the precedent: its ranks put `InteractionManifestV1` at 1
and `ProviderExecutionReceiptV1` at 2, beneath the reports — a ladder over the
whole typed reference graph, not over envelopes.

Consequence for the registry: a typed support object must be admissible as an
edge **source**, not only as a target. The concrete shape of that is v2 drafting,
not Phase G.

Deciding an object is not a message does not make it stop being a node. Naming
the two classes separately is what makes that mistake visible instead of
structural.

The registry's two edge classes are adopted as they stand: `Intra` (within one
round's derivation flow, must topologically sort at kind level) and `Causal`
(crossing rounds, chains or attention lineage; instance-acyclic by
create-before-reference). The distinction is load-bearing and rank cannot
express it at all, which is independent evidence for this change: the two classes
are proved acyclic by different arguments — kind-level topological sort versus
per-instance create-before-reference — and a single scalar cannot carry two proof
obligations. (G-R1's earlier justification, that §3.1's promotion turned on a
`Causal` edge, died with that promotion and is not reused here.)

One open target is sanctioned, unchanged from the design input's rationale:
`AnyCommittedEnvelope`, for `CampaignFeedItem` causation. `AnyImportableCas`
leaves with `ArtifactImported` (§3.4).

## 5. Q4 + Q5 — imported roots, closure, and the typed external boundary

### 5.1 The wrapper classification: `PARSED_BUT_GRAPH_TERMINAL`

v1's FD-2.4 says imported roots are *never parsed by A1*, while every typed A0/R1
wrapper in the design input is parsed by A1 — `CandidateStateReceiptRefV1` reads
a `source_run_id`, checks `ArtifactKind::CandidateState`, and carries an exact
`RunEventId`. Both cannot be true. This is the same seam R5.1 hit with
`ScopeContractV1` and repaired by redefining rank 0; it recurs because the
underlying distinction was never named.

Frozen for v2:

```text
PARSED_BUT_GRAPH_TERMINAL

A1 owns and validates the wrapper's syntax and local invariants.
A1 may carry enough foreign identity to select an exact A0/R1 fact.
Semantic validity of that fact remains owned by the A0/R1 verifier.
Cross-layer resolution proves the boundary relation and nothing beyond it.
The foreign authority does not become an A1 graph node, and its internal
references are never traversed as A1 edges.
```

So "terminal" means terminal *in the graph*, and says nothing about parseability;
parseability is decided per slot. `OPAQUE_TERMINAL` remains available for any
future import that A1 genuinely hands off unread, and `OTHER` requires explicit
new justification.

V0 wrapper set, after §3.4 and §3.5 remove two:

```text
CandidateStateReceiptRef        in-degree 6
CandidateMaterializationRef     in-degree 3
WorktreeMaterializationRef      in-degree 2
RunContractCandidateStateRef    in-degree 2
```

### 5.2 Closure semantics

Unchanged from v1 in substance, with one clarification the above forces:

```text
closure traversal enters a wrapper to validate it, and stops there.
It never follows the foreign authority's own internal references.
Accounting charges the wrapper, not the foreign object graph behind it.
```

The FD-1.5 bounds, the deduplication key `(kind, digest)`, declared-size-before-read
accounting and all-or-nothing rejection are untouched by Phase G.

## 6. E-V0-4 — the part that belongs to Phase G, and the part that does not

E-V0-4 has two halves. Only one is a taxonomy question.

**In scope — the manifest's class, and nothing else.** §3.3 settles it: a
**typed support object, not envelope-bearing**. That is the whole of Phase G's
mandate here.

**Out of scope — every number.** The first pass went one step further and
concluded that the class implies the bound: typed support object, therefore the
1 MiB control-artifact bound, therefore `manifest` leaves the evidence-blob list.
That does not follow. Class and size are orthogonal — a support object may carry
its own per-kind hard bound, and the design input does exactly that, giving the
manifest 2 MiB. Deciding the bound from the class would have been Phase G quietly
amending FD-1.4, which is the failure this section was written to name and then
committed anyway.

So all of it defers to v2 wire/bounds drafting, together with the envelope-size
seam:

```text
is the manifest 1 MiB, 64 MiB, or a per-kind bound of its own?
does MAX_INTERACTION_SEQUENCE change instead?
what bounds stored envelope bytes, given FD-1.8 sums envelope + payload?
```

Phase G supplies the classification these questions need and answers none of
them.

`E-V0-1`, `E-V0-2` and `E-V0-3` are **not** Phase G material at all. They are
convergence inputs about the checked-parse boundary, scalar bounds and
repository-relative validation. Pulling them in because they sit nearby in
`e202ac1` would turn Phase G into "let us also rewrite the wire layer", which is
the failure this phase exists to prevent.

## 7. What Phase G did not decide

- envelope v2 field set, framing order, or any digest domain;
- `message_kind_version` per kind — an output of v2 drafting, once payload shapes
  are known;
- the envelope-size bound (§6);
- dispositions for any of the 141 negative-matrix rows or the 47 frozen decisions;
- anything about `E-V0-1`, `E-V0-2`, `E-V0-3`;
- whether the import mechanism of §3.4 exists as a controller procedure — only
  that it does not exist as a node.

## 8. For the independent reviewer (revision G-R2)

The count survived the second review. Attack these, in order:

1. **§3.1, `CampaignRunBinding` as support rather than message.** The negative is
   the load-bearing claim: *no* V0 invariant needs a `message_id`, envelope
   causation and an acceptance lifecycle here. One counterexample overturns it.
   G-R2 already found the near miss — binding uniqueness had been placed after
   dispatch — and repaired it as a controller obligation rather than a promotion.
   Is that repair sufficient, or does durable pre-dispatch admission smuggle in a
   message lifecycle under another name?
2. **§3.2, `ProviderInvocationReceipt` staying a support object.** Same shape: is
   there an envelope-specific invariant that neither pass has looked for?
3. **§2, the metric.** `specific V0 consumer in-degree` now has an explicit
   exclusion rule. Re-derive it independently and check the numbers — that is
   what the previous round's exclusions were missing.
4. **§3.4, `ArtifactImported` as NOT PROVEN.** Zero specific-consumer degree is
   strong, but the design input is a prototype: is there a real V0 import
   consumer merely unwired, which would make this premature?
5. **§4, derived rank over the Intra subgraph only.** Does anything need a rank
   across Causal edges, which by construction cannot have one?

## 9. Revision record

### G-R2 — second independent review, two P1s

`CHANGES_REQUESTED`; the central conclusion of eleven envelope kinds was not
challenged and is unchanged. Both findings accepted.

1. **Binding uniqueness was enforced too late.** G-R1 delegated "one binding per
   execution" to the acceptance of a later referencing artifact — after the
   provider dispatch that the binding exists to identify. Two bindings for one
   execution could both clear the pre-dispatch stretch, and a post-factum
   rejection repairs nothing. Replaced by a **pre-dispatch binding admission**
   invariant: exactly one binding identity established durably before the first
   dispatch, same-B replay idempotent, different-B a fail-closed conflict with no
   dispatch, and the same resolution after restart. Recorded explicitly as a
   controller/reducer obligation that is *not* a reason to promote, with a
   reopening trigger if the v2 draft cannot express it without a message
   lifecycle.
2. **Derived rank was defined over the wrong graph.** G-R1 narrowed it to the
   `Intra` *message-kind* subgraph, one paragraph after demoting three objects
   that are not terminals — `ProviderInvocationReceipt` (out-degree 9),
   `CampaignRunBinding` (5), `InteractionManifest` (3). Half the receipt chain
   would have fallen out of the acyclicity proof. Widened to the `Intra` **typed-node**
   subgraph, following frozen v1's own precedent, where rank 1 was the manifest
   and rank 2 the receipt. Consequence recorded: a typed support object must be
   admissible as an edge source, not only as a target.

Tails: `ArtifactImported` now reads *specific V0 consumer in-degree = 0* rather
than a bare "in-degree zero"; the external wrapper column is labelled as raw
explicit degree, a deliberately different metric that keeps POST-V0 references
visible; and §4's justification no longer cites the promotion G-R1 cancelled.

The characteristic error this round: having correctly decided an object is not a
message, the document nearly forgot it is still a node — and still a pre-dispatch
authority. Which is a fair demonstration of why the two classes needed separate
names in the first place.

### G-R1 — first independent review, four P1s

`CHANGES_REQUESTED` on the first pass. All four accepted; the central conclusion
changed from thirteen envelope kinds to eleven.

1. **Evidence accounting was imprecise.** "53 edges" named the envelope-source
   projection, not the registry, which holds 59 entries plus a global
   `AnyCommittedEnvelope` causation rule. §2 now defines *specific V0 consumer
   in-degree* with an explicit exclusion rule, so an independent reviewer running
   "the same" script arrives at the same numbers. Raw in-degree for
   `ArtifactImported` is not zero; its specific-consumer degree is.
2. **`CampaignRunBinding`'s promotion evidence did not hold.** The `Causal`
   in-edge belongs to SafeRedrive, which is POST-V0 — letting it decide V0 wire
   ontology is backwards. And "two producer lanes" was simply false:
   `required_producer()` classifies both referencing kinds as `Controller`.
   Re-adjudicated as a typed support authority.
3. **`ProviderInvocationReceipt`'s promotion argument was wrong.** FD-5.3
   governs payloads of envelope-bearing artifacts; the receipt has none, so its
   `campaign_id`/`round_id` restate nothing. And FD-11's two congruence
   predicates survive promotion unchanged, because they prove cross-object
   provenance rather than police intra-object duplication. Reverted to
   `KEEP_V1_MODEL`.
4. **E-V0-4 drifted from taxonomy into bounds.** Class does not imply size — the
   design input gives the manifest its own 2 MiB bound — so concluding "typed
   support object, therefore 1 MiB, therefore out of the evidence-blob list" was
   Phase G amending FD-1.4 one paragraph after warning against exactly that. All
   numeric resolution deferred.

Also: derived rank narrowed to the `Intra` kind-level subgraph, since the full
graph does not topologically sort; and the `ArtifactAcceptance` analogy demoted
from proof to caution.

The pattern behind items 2 and 3 is one error, not two. The script proved
correctly *who references whom*; the document then took one step further and
treated "is referenced" as "is a message". Being referenced is a property of the
graph. Being a message is a claim about identity, lifecycle and acceptance, and it
has to be argued separately every time.
